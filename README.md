# Function-time-cost

Problem Statement goes below:

1.Measure the cost of a minimal function call in C/C++ (cost in terms of time taken). The minimal cost could be emulated by measuring a bare function call that neither takes any parameter nor does anything inside the function. ï‚·

2.Measure the cost of a minimal system call in C/C++. Unlike a regular function call, a system call traps into the operating system kernel. The minimal cost can be emulated by measuring the cost of getpid () which doesn't really do anything.

3.Measure the cost of a read/write system call in C/C++. ( Hint : You can fork a child process and transfer one byte between parent and child) For the above measurements, you will need to repeat the experiment many times and then take the average.

How to tests:

#define EXP 10000 //experiment time, easier for data analyze

is the part to change the experiment
We can change this part to do the test

From the above test, it is obvious to figure one fact, which is the trend. As we increase
the repeated time of this experiment, the execution time for both function call and system call decrease a lot.
